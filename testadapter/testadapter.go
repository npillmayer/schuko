/*
Package testadapter is for application configuration during tests.

Clients will start configuration explicitely with a call to

	gconf.Initialize(testadapter.New())

There is no init() call to set up configuration a priori. The reason
is to avoid coupling to a specific configuration framework, but rather
relay this decision to the client.
