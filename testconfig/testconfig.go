// QuickConfig sets up a configuration suitable for test cases, including tracing.
// It returns a teardown function which should be called at the end of a test.
// The usual pattern will look like this:
//
//     func TestSomething(t *testing.T) {
//          teardown := testconfig.QuickConfig(t)
//          defer teardown()
//          ...
//      }
//
func QuickConfig(t *testing.T, maps ...map[string]string) func() {
	schuko.AddTraceAdapter("test", gotestingadapter.GetAdapter())
	c := testadapter.New()
	c.Set("tracing", "test")
	for _, m := range maps {
		for k, v := range m {
			c.Set(k, v)
		}
	}
	gconf.Initialize(c)
	return gotestingadapter.RedirectTracing(t)
