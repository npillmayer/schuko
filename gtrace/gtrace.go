/*
Package gtrace lets clients set up a set of global tracers.
It infects clients with the semantics of tracing for the gotype-application.
However, the imposed overhead is very slim, i.e. boils down to having
some global variables declared (but not necessarily used):

	CommandTracer     : Tracing interactive or batch commands from users
	CoreTracer        : Tracing application core
	ScriptingTracer   : Tracing embedded scripting host(s)
	InterpreterTracer : Tracing DSL interpreting
	SyntaxTracer      : Tracing lexing/parsing of DSLs
	GraphicsTracer    : Tracing graphics routines
	EngineTracer      : Tracing web-engine routines
	EquationsTracer   : Tracing arithmetic

Clients are free to selectively use any of these tracers.
They are initially set up to do nothing (no-ops).
Clients will use the configuration package to set it up in a
meaningful way.
